<p> It started about a few days before August 19th, but those days aren't important so we'll ignore them, yeah? August 19th. <br> The first football game of the year. I was excited to go because it would mean seeing my best friend <br> whom I hadn't seen in quite some time. She went to a different school, but talked her mom into taking her to my school's game. <br> But anyway, it started out with me waiting because she was running late. Almost an hour late. I was waiting by the concession stand because food, <br> and a friend of mine comes up and asks if I'd talk to a guy she told me <br> about not too long ago. I had said at somepoint that night I would, and I had meant it. <br> I waiting a bit longer, and then finally she arrived. We started walking around and talking, <br> and eventually the guy in question came up. She expressed disliking him, and claiming <br> that he seemed unstable, to say the least. He was cute, but I was willing to go with whatever <br> my friend said, because she is exponentially smarter than I. Anyway, she came up with the idea of pretending we were dating <br> because the guy kept making the notion to talk to me. (By notion, I mean he was creepily walking past us several times.) At some point, he ended up going home which I was glad for, <br> because she had more bad ideas, some on the assholish side. I finally managed to get home and showered, and then felt I should <br> apologize to that kid, so I did. We started talking, and before I knew it I was up until 2 AM talking to him most nights. <br> He was great to talk to, he was nice, sympathetic, and funny. We talked for a while, and I had started to like him. <br> We made jokes about dating, and got into arguments about the jokes. At some point, I had wished he would've take the <br> "joke" seriously, and we could've started dating sooner. Anyway, we talked for a couple more weeks, almost a month. <br> Finally, he called me out for mind games (which in all honesty I was guilty of) and he asked where we stood, <br> because he wasn't feeling all that great and didn't have time for mind games. I tried to be clear, as clear as I could. <br> I made it apparent that I liked him, but I wasn't ready for a relationship. I wanted to get to know him more first. <br> That lasted a whole day, then I said yeah lets date. We dated, and he hugged me. God, I loved his hugs. God, I miss them. <br> He hugged tight, some might say a little too tight but not me, I wanted to be near him and the hugs brought us really close. <br> He was always comfy and inviting and warm, and when he hugged me I fell in love every second. I never wanted to let go. <br> That's what I miss the most. His hugs, the hugs that brought us together. It was a week after. September the 18th. <br> I thought I had a genius idea. I was home alone and had alcohol, it was the perfect oppurtunity for my first time. <br> I might've (must've) gone a bit overboard, because I ended up breaking up with him then passing out soon after. <br> I tried to apologize, several times. He just kinda pushed me away. I still see him in the halls, and this week has taken <br> a huge toll on me. He looks unaffected, as though I was never anything to him. I guess that would explain why he never said <br> he liked me, let alone loved me. Just seeing him is enough to hurt me. It got so bad one day, and I needed a quick release, <br> so I cut. It felt good at first, then it burned. It took my mind off of it, though. It's become something of an addiction. <br> It feels good, and it helps. I never do it deep enough to make extremely visible scars, though. And I never do it deep <br> enough to really hurt myself. </p> 
<p class="shadow"> Perhaps it isn't so bad, death. <br> It means an end to this pain and suffering. <br> I suppose I can't complain, though. I brought it on myself. </p>
